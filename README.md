# Defend-against-cyberthreats-with-Microsoft-Defender-XDR
This Microsoft applied skills included Defend against threats with Microsoft Defender (XDR) Assessment Lab where I was asked to perform several activities from a series of email messages. This assessment is intentionally designed to reflect real-world, problem-solving scenarios which I will walkthrough in this repository.

# Scenario:
You were recently hired by Contoso, Ltd to help the company's IT team to Defend against threats with Microsoft Defender (XDR). The company's executives are very concerned that all guidelines are followed and that all requirements are met when you complete the activities in their environment.

The guidelines and requirements are detailed in a series of emails. Read the email messages and complete the activities according to the provided requirements. You can complete the activities from the Microsoft Defender portal or from any other Microsoft tool available in the virtual machine.
